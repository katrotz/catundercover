                            As long as I could consciously remember myself I would have a pencil anywhere I would go, sketching stuff that would inspire me, or at least stuff that I would find eye-catching. My parents strongly believed in my creative side and agreed I should follow a creative career (or at least do what I loved to do at the moment) so I started with art school besides my regular educational activities. After finiahing art school during my teenage years I continued illustrating using different mediums like watercolor, gouache and oils on paper and other objects in the meantime enrolling in some art courses to help grow my passion for illustration. My hard work has been repaid with different prizes at local and cross country painting and art contests.

                            My love affair with drawing ended briefly when I decided to pursue a technical Bachelors degree after school and enrolled in Computer Science at the State University in my city. My first part-time job as a student was writing travel guides for a company and dreaming of visiting all of those countries I wrote about one day. After finishing university as most of the confused students freshly out of school - I decided to move to sunny Cyprus and continue my copy writing career writing about design and other nerdy subjects for magazines like Designmodo.

                        <p>I have then decided islands are not my thing and moved back to my home country where I got a job as a technical writer for a Danish web design & development company. Everything went great for a while when I understood that my creative side couldn’t hide and be confused much longer and seeing that web design clicked with me during my work experience as a technical writer I decided to start learning on my own after work and spent time with design books and online magazines. I then decided to take my design book knowledge and cute attempts to design a bit further and apply it in real life by contacting different design agencies in my home city and ended up working for a great agency, where I was hired as a Junior Web Designer and worked at tons of beautiful projects along with a great team and professional web designers.</p>
